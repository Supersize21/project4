Need to have plurals.
Need to switch to singular when checking with database.
Need to switch to plural when taking information out of database in certain cases.
functions need to be able to process "what the plural of X" inputs.

When giving outputs, puncations are required in correct places.

AddFacts() is still incomplete.  It doesn't update the database correctly (since we added a new KB that could keep track of all these properties)
